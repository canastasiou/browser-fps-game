# Browser First Person 3D Game

This project is a simple browser-based first-person 3D game built using HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and CSS. It utilizes the Three.js library via CDN to create a 3D environment where players can move around on a grass green plane.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML document that sets up the game environment.
- `css/style.css`: Contains styles for the game, including background color and canvas styling.
- `js/game.js`: The main game logic that initializes the Three.js scene, camera, and renderer.
- `js/player.js`: Defines the player character and handles movement and interaction.
- `js/controls.js`: Manages user input for controlling the player.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start the game.

## Game Controls

- Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the player around the environment.
- Additional controls can be implemented in the future.

## Features

- A basic grass green plane as the ground.
- Simple player movement mechanics.
- Built with Three.js for 3D rendering.
